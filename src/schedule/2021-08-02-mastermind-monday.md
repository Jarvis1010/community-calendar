Welcome to the first server mastermind event!

These sessions are a time to share what our monthly goals, open up to suggestion, and encourage each other in our efforts to achieve them. We have so many creators in the server that it'll be fun to see where everyone is headed and how they plan to get there.

Participation rules:

- Participation is welcome but not required — it's totally OK to lurk
- Be respectful of other's time. Keep reports and suggestions brief and focused
- We'll be learning as we go. So, uggestions welcome!
