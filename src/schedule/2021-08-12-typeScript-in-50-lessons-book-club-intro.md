Welcome to the TypeScript in 50 Lessons club!

This is a short-term community group for owners of the book TypeScript in 50 Lessons. The only requirement is that you own the book.

- [Amazaon — Kindle-only](https://amzn.to/3lr3ahA) (affiliate link)
- [Smashing Magazine — all formats](https://typescript-book.com)

During this first group, we'll cover the introduction, learning expectations, format, and appetite for future meetings.

## Notes

### Why are you interested in TypeScript?

- **MG**: props
- **BM**:
  - Hype, keeping up with the industry
  - Already has a toe dipped in via JSDoc
  - People often introduce one of two ways:
    - "JS devs are bad at their jobs and need TS"
    - "Better dev tooling for existing code"
- **TWM**:
  - Used it at work
  - Identifying what you don't know you don't know
- **MA**:
  - Getting foundation right
- **VP**:
  - Dev Tooling
  - Large teams sharing
- **FT**:
  - Working with TS for months but getting lost in complications
  - Career development

### Which structural typed languages have you used?

- C#
- Java
- Scala

### Takeaways from Intro

#### Values

- Properly used TypeScript can be like pairing with your past self
- Guides refactoring
- Errors at "authoring" time
- We can progressively migrate to TypeScript

#### Identity

> If there are "TypeScript Devs," I guess the rest of us are "Babel Devs"

#### De-motivations

- Condescending community (JS devs are less than)

#### Persona to avoid

- Proselyte
- "Superman for problems that don't exist" — BM

#### Persona to embrace

- Acknowledge business constraints
  - Not everyone is allowed to use TS
- Progressive adoption (use TS where it provides the most lift)

### Places where TypeScript might not be a great fit

- Action faking
  - "I just need to improve these types before starting that feature…"
- "Types are like concrete. They provide a strong foundation, if a rigid foundation is what you need"
  - "gluing lego together"
- Ask Kyle Simpson's question "What are you losing with TypeScript?"
- Where exploration speed of exploration is a high value

### Chapters we're most excited about

- Generics
- Conditional Types
