Welcome to the TypeScript in 50 Lessons club!

This is a short-term community group for owners of the book TypeScript in 50 Lessons. The only requirement is that you own the book.

- [Amazaon — Kindle-only](https://amzn.to/3lr3ahA) (affiliate link)
- [Smashing Magazine — all formats](https://typescript-book.com)

During this first group, we'll cover the introduction, learning expectations, format, and appetite for future meetings.
